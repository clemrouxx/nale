# NaLE

NaLE is Not a LaTeX Editor. The point of this project is to provide a easy-to-use tool for writing scientific articles while writing as little (if any) LaTeX as possible. The goal is to have a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get editor that compiles to PDF through LaTeX.

An online demo of NaLE can be accessed at https://clemrouxx.github.io/nale/

In this repo, you will find a sample file 'sample.nale' that you can open in NaLE to get an idea of what can be easily created.
